# Contraception failure in the United States

Given Given the reinstatement of the Trump administration in November, we kick off the #TidyRainbow initiative with data related to contraceptive failure in the United States.

## About the data

This data is taken from the article [Contraceptive failure in the United States](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638209/).

## Data dictionary

`method`: method of contraception
`typical_use`: % of women experiencing an unintended pregnancy within the first year of use, given typical use
`perfect_use`: % of women experiencing an unintended pregnancy within the first year of use, given perfect use
`continuing_at_one_year`: % of women continuing use at one year

## Why this is relevant

It may seem strange to kick-off #TidyRainbow with a data set that isn't specifically about LGBTQ+ issues and which does not explicitly include non-binary genders or LGBTQ+ people. But, make no mistake, reproductive freedom is relevant to our community and, in the immediate wake of the overturning of Roe vs Wade, it is essential to address this issue.

Firstly, there are members of our community with a uterus who are having sex with people with sperm. 

Secondly, anyone of child-bearing age with a uterus is at risk of an unwanted pregnancy through coerced intercourse.

Most importantly, issues of reproductive justice should concern everyone, but specifically those who care about bodily autonomy and the rights of minoritised communities. And, make no mistake, in the USA, the rights of LGBTQ+ people are very much on the line. Marriage equality is liable to be struck down using the same argument that overturned access to legal, safe abortions. Stay engaged, folks.
